# Chronic-Kidney-Disease
This project develops a predictive model for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using machine learning to aid early diagnosis and intervention, enhancing patient outcomes and reducing costs. Using a dataset of 400 patients with 26 features, including age, blood pressure, and lab results, the model predicts CKD presence.
